# Conclusion

### Example

* [aes](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/IMDb/tree/master/tutorials/aes): an example of a manually defined ILA model. 

### FAQ

* **Does ILAng perform any form of simplification on the model?** Currently, ILAng only have AST simplification based on the hash value over the topological structure. More aggressive simplification such as functional reduction may be supported in the future.
