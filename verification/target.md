# Verification Target

The verification target can be generated by create a `VerilogVerificationTargetGenerator` object. Some prerequisites are:

1. ILAng should be configured to have the switch `ILANG_INSTALL_DEV` turned on.
2. Include the header `ilang/vtarget-out/vtarget_gen.h`

The arguments of the constructors are:

1. A list of paths to search for Verilog include files
2. A list of Verilog design files
3. The Verilog top module
4. The variable mapping file \(first part of refinement map\)
5. The instruction start/ready conditions \(second part of refinement map\)
6. The output path of the verification targets
7. The ILA model
8. The choice backend \(CoSA/JapserGold, the latter is not open-source and not included in the demo\)
9. \(Optional\) Target generator configuration
10. \(Optional\) Verilog generator configuration
