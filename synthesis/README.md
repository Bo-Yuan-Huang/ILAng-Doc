# Synthesis

This section covers how to synthesize an ILA formal model using the template-based synthesis engine [ItSy](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/ItSy), an implementation of [TCAD18](https://bo-yuan-huang.github.io/ILAng-Doc/tcad18.pdf). You will learn how to write a synthesis template and to interface the design simulator.
